					<h4 class="fishBehavior-h4">Understanding Fish Behavior Will Help You to Catch More Fish</h4>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading ">A fish lives in a harsh dangerous world where the odds are against it from the time of it's birth. Only a very small percentage of them avoid becoming prey in the first year of life. For a fish survival is a matter of concealing itself from larger fish and putting on weight as quickly as possible. Understanding this will give you a better insight into where fish are likely to be in a given body of water at a given time and what baits will be most effective.</h3>
					<h4 class="fishBehavior-h4">Fish like to see and not be seen.</h4>
					<h3 class="section-subheading ">Toward that end most fish like to relate to objects in the water or irregularities in the bottom that allow them to blend into the background. Fisherman call these objects and irregularities, "structure". Fish, by stationing themselves near weedbeds, rocks, fallen trees or in the shadows become more difficult to spot by other fish allowing them to ambush smaller fish and avoid being eaten by larger fish. If you look at most freshwater fish you will see that they have dark stripes or splotches on their sides that tend to break up their outline much as modern camoflage clothing does for soldiers. In addition most fish have bellies that are lighter than their sides sometimes even white. This is so that the fish don't show up so well against the sky when viewed from below by another fish..</h3>
					<h4 class="fishBehavior-h4">Fish like to be near deep water</h4>
					<h3 class="section-subheading ">Most species of fish feel safer if they can retreat quickly into deeper water. Any place with a shallow area near a drop off will tend to hold fish. In shallow water fish tend to be more cautious and will spook easily, which requires greater care in lure delivery.</br>
					Where structure is scarce fish hang by the banks especially in early spring as the water warms.</h3>
					<h4 class="fishBehavior-h4">Moving water</h4>
					<h3 class="section-subheading ">In streams and rivers fish seek areas of slow to moderate current where they can wait for a meal without expending too much energy. These areas of slow current are on the bottom, along the banks, in front of and behind obstacles such as rocks and fallen trees. If they are actively feeding they will generally be facing upstream and into the current. In such situations it is best to cast upstream and bring the lure downstream to the fish. When the water is low fish are more likely to venture into the center of the stream. When water is cloudy and fast moving, fish like to stay near the bank or at the inlets of small streams where there are eddies and food opportunities</h3>
					<h4 class="fishBehavior-h4">Fish are cold blooded creatures</h4>
					<h3 class="section-subheading ">Fish can be caught anytime of the year, however when the water is cold you will have to realize that you will not have as much success as during the summer. Since fish are cold blooded creatures their metabolism slows so they don't feed as often. In addition lure presentation must be slow, you have to make it easy for them to get the lure. Fish will tend to congregate in areas of the warmest and most stable water temperatures leaving large stretches of water empty of fish. However if you come across one of these congregations then the fishing can be pretty good.</h3>

                                <h2>Surf Fishing on the Atlantic Coast</h2>
								<img class="img-responsive " src="img/portfolio/surfrods.jpg" alt="">
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">As the wind blows across the ocean, some of that wind energy is transfered to the water in the form of waves. In the deep water they will travel hundreds of miles and often are hardly noticeable. Once the waves hit the shallow water they swell up until they crest and break on the shore. It is in this interface between land and sea where many creatures including fish and fishermen find food opportunities.
								One of the charms of fishing from the beach is that you never can be really certain of what you will catch. It could be anything from a 1 lb kingfish to a 60 lb red drum or even a spider crab.</p>
                                <h3> How to Surf Fish</h3> 
                                <p>In general surf fishing requires casting relatively long distances usually at poorly defined underwater structure, although this is not always the case. That being said one of the most common errors made by a beginning surf caster it to attempt to use brute force to power their cast, usually with mixed results.</p>
                                <h3> Where the fish are</h3> 
                                <p>In a sandy beach during high tide there will generally be a trough or slough formed in the sand parallel to the shore by the breaking waves. This slough can be identified as a area of flat water between initial cresting waves and the waves breaking on shore.
								At low tide fish tend to be farther out some times beyond the sand bar.</p>
                               <h3> Equipment</h3> 
                               <p>It is possible to have success with a fresh water rod only 6 or 7 feet long and 10 pound line if the seas are calm and the wind is light, however it is better to use a longer rod. A 9 or 10 foot medium action rod with a saltwater spinning reel loaded with 15 to 20 pound line is a good start. Don't go overboard either, stick with a rod 12 feet or less and no line heavier that 25 pounds until you gain some experience.</p>
                               <h3> Equipment to Start Out With</h3> 	
                                <ol class="ol-model">
                                    <li>Waders - hip or chest waders - if the water is too cold to wade in</li>
                                    <li>Surf Rod and reel</li>
                                    <li>Assorted weights pyramid sinkers 2 to 4 ounces</li>
									<li>Some hooks, sizes 2 to 1/0</li>
									<li>Stainless steel pliers</li>
									<li>Headlamp - if fishing at night</li>
									<li>Sand spike</li>
                                </ol>
								<p>Although many serious surf fishermen use artificial lures, most will use natural baits such as bloodworms or bunker. Usually the local bait shop can give you a good idea of what will work best for a given time of year or set of weather conditions. </p>

                                <h2>Common Saltwater Fishing Rigs</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">There are a multitude of pretied saltwater fishing rigs that you can buy but it is often cheaper buy some terminal tackle and to tie your own. The following are some of the simpler common surf rigs. An improved clinch knot is one of the easier knots to use to tie on terminal tackle.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/clinchknot.gif" alt="">
								<h3> Surf or Bottom Rig</h3> 
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/surfrig.jpg" alt="">
								<p>Probably the simplest surf rig that you can use, it works well for bottom feeders such as kingfish and is less likely to tangle than the dropper rig.</p>
                               <h3> Float Rig</h3> 
							   <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/floatrig.jpg" alt="">
							   <p>The float rig will keep bait visible to passing fish and away from crabs lurking on the bottom. They are frequently used when fishing for flounder as well.</p>
							   <h3>Dropper Rig</h3>
							   <p>A dropper or high low rig has two wire arms projecting from it. Allows you to fish with two different baits at the same time. Commonly used when fishing from a pier or in the surf.</p>
							   <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/dropperrig.jpg" alt="">
								<h3>Fish Finder Rig</h3>
								<p>A fish finder rig is designed to keep the bait off of the bottom away from crabs and to provide a more visible presentation to foraging fish. The baited hook can rise and fall with waves varying the depth as the line is free slide through the swivel that is tied to the sinker.</p>

                                <h2>Natural Baits for Saltwater Fishing</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">There are a variety of natural baits suitable for surf fishing. Most beginners would do well to start off with bloodworms and cut bait made from menhaden. In general the fresher the bait, the better it will stay on the hook and the more appealing it will be game fish. In warm weather, I will usually have a smalll styrofoam cooler that I will use just to hold bait.</p>
                                <h3>Bloodworms</h3>
								<p>These aquatic brownish red worms can grow to 15 inches long and are eaten by most species of surf fish at one time or another. Bloodworms burrow in silty sand or clay flats that are below high tide. Digging them can be work but it might be worth while since they tend to be expensive. This bait can be very effective in spite of the expense. Handle them with care, they have a retractable beak capable of inflicting a very nasty bite. Use these whole or in pieces. Bloodworms will last 3 or 4 days if kept cool in damp seaweed but they will last longer if they are refrigerated. Do not expose them to freshwater otherwise a gooey mess will be the result.</p>
								<h3>Earthworms and Nightcrawers</h3>
								<p>Terrestrial earthworms have been used with some success in fishing for Spot and Croaker and are considerably cheaper than bloodworms. They may be kept for several days if they are kept cool and are not exposed to saltwater.</p>
								<h3>Squid</h3>
								<p>Squid is fished whole or in pieces. For someone starting out surf fishing it is probably best to use a piece of squid rather that a whole one. A small type of squid known as calamari is sold frozen in most supermarkets. Cut the squid into strips 3 to 4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.</p>
								<h3>Peeler Crab</h3>
								<p>Peeler Crabs are crabs that are molting or have molted and while the new shell is still soft. They are also known as soft shell crabs they can be used whole or cut in half. As a bait they can be rather expensive.</p>
								<h3>Clams, mussels and other bivalves</h3>
								<p>The shells are removed and the hook is passed through the tough muscle.</p>
								<h3>Clams snouts</h3>
								<p>These are the siphons that are removed from clams when they are processed. They are usually sold frozen.</p>
								<h3>Cut bait</h3>
								<p>The term cut bait, generally refers to pieces of fresh cut fish such as bunker and mullet. Bunker are also known as atlantic menhaden.</p>
								<h3>Shrimp</h3>
								<p>Shrimp will attract most species of saltwater gamefish. They are usually peeled for best results.</p>
								<h3>Mole Crabs</h3>
								<p>Also known as the Sand Flea, the mole crab is a crustacean commonly found in the sand below the high water mark. They are used primarily as bait for Pompanos but may also be used to fish for flounder, sheepshead and even kingfish.</p>
								<h3>Killies</h3>
								<p>Killies are a minnow like fish found in the still water of bays and estuaries. They survive well in a bucket as long as the water is changed periodically. They can often be purchased but some people will go to the trouble of catching them with a throwing net.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Striped bass and Bluefish are quite possibly the two most popular gamefish on the east coast.</p>

								<h4>Pomatomus saltatrix</h4>
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/bluefish.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>Description:Long bodied streamlined fish with bluish or greenish coloration on back becoming lighter on lower sides with a white belly. Tail is sharply forked. Mouth is full of very sharp teeth. They generally travel in a large school where the individual fish are approximately equal in size. Steel leaders should be used when fishing for bluefish. Generally the most productive time for fishing for Blues is 2 hours before and an hour after high tide. 
								Natural Baits : Cut bait or live bunker , squid </br>
								Artificial lures - Minnow immitations, silver spoons and jigs with a fast retrieve </br>
								Small blues are considered to be very tasty but the meat of larger bluefish is not as well liked. Also the flesh of bluefish does not freeze as well as other species of fish. 
								Average size - 1 to 15 pounds </br>
								Largest expected size 32 pounds </p>
