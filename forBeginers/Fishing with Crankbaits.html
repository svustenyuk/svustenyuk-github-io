<h1>Crankbaits and How to Fish Them</h1>

<p> To use crankbaits to the best effect, they moved through the water with a jerky stop and go retrieve to simulate a fish or other creature in distress.

<h3>Top Water or Surface plugs </h3>
<p>Top water plugs are floating lures without a lip.  They are most commonly designed to emulate wounded baitfish.
 Topwater lures for fishing in shallow water less the 4 feet.  I particularly like using them at night as they are less likely to snag on weeds than diving plugs. 
 Dark colors silhouette nicely against the night sky.</p>

One of the  oldest types is the popper with a concave face.  As it is reeled in with short twitches it scoops up water creating a small splash in front of it. 
There are also prop baits with little propellers which spin as the lure is pulled through the water

Surface plugs are most frequently used in shallow water less than 5 feet, early in the morning, late in the afternoon or at night when bass move to shallow water to feed.

<h3>Plugs for Ultralight Fishing </h3>

<p>These minature plugs are used with 4 to 6 pound line in shallow water.
I have caught not only bass with ultralight crankbaits but panfish and crappie as well.
