<p>The brown bullhead is a catfish commonly found in beds of vegetation in warm water ponds and sluggish streams. It is able to survive in water with low oxygen content by breathing air.
</p>
<p>
They can grow to a  maximum size is about 16 inches or 3 pounds. 6 to 12 inches in length and less than 2 pounds is the more usual range. </p>
<p>Bullheads are omnivourous and feed on a variety of plant and animal material.</p>
<p>
 Although the fish pictured above was caught on a jig with a white 2 inch twirl tail grub, you will likely have far greater success catching bullheads with natural baits than you will when
using artificial lures. Some good baits are earth worms, dough balls or pieces of hot dog.
