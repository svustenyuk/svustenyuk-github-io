<h1>Rigging Soft Plastics</h1>
<p>Since the development in the 1960's of soft plastic lures, they have become exceedingly popular due to their effectiveness and relatively low cost.Fish seem less inclined to spit them out than hard baits such as plugs and spinners.  Often they are just the thing for for cautious bass. </p>
<p>  With the exception of flyfishermen, you would be hard pressed to find any serious angler who didn't have at least some rubber worms or grub in his tackle box. </p> 
<p>The lures are manufactured in a great variety of colors and styles which is both a boon and a curse to the fisherman.

<h3>Rubber grubs or Twirl tail jigs </h3>

<p>Among the most effective lures expecially for small waters(pond and streams) is the curly tail grub with a lead head jig. 
 This is a particular favorite of mine when fishing with an ultralight rod and reel as these lures not only attract a wide variety of fish
they are also comparitively inexpensive so that it is not a tragedy when they snag on submerged brush or rock.
</p>
<p>The grub is a  J shaped piece of soft plastic which comes in a variety of colors and lengths from one inch to 4 inches or more. 
It is threaded onto a jig head so that the tail will move freely when it is drawn through the water.
I generally use a 2 inch soft plastic grub most often with a 1/32 to 1/8 ounce jig head. A three inch plastic grub on a 1/16 to 1/4 ounce jig head.
 As a general rule it is best to use dark colored lures in stained and turbid water and lighter colors in clear water.
Black, white, yellow and Chartruse are grub colors that no fisherman should be without.

<h3>Soft plastic worms </h3> 
<p>
 The key to fishing plastic worms it to fish them slowly  and methodically around  through the cover.

</p>
<p> In areas with dense cover such as water lilies  and other aquatic vegetation a texas rigged plastic worm will not snag where other lures will.</p>

<h3> Carolina Rig </h3>
<p>A derivative of the old fish finder rig, the carolina rig is generally used to fish  deeper water than the texas rig.
It is tied by sliding a bullet weight or egg sinker on the line, followed by a plastic bead and a swivel. Most commonly sinkers of 1/2 to 1 oz  are used when fishing with 12 to 20 pound lines.
 The plastic bead protects the knot on the swivel from being abraded by the sinker. Two to three feet of monofilament line is tied to the swivel with a worm hook/soft plastic lure on the end.</p>

<p>As the rig is dragged along the bottom it creates a vibration much like that of foraging fish.  The unweighted trail lure will alternately rise and fall with a stop and go retrieve. The sliding weight reduces the initial resistance when a fish moves off with the lure. </p>
